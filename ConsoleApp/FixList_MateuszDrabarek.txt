 Recruitment task for Dataedo, solved by Mateusz Drabarek
 */
 
1. Removed a typo in the spelling of the file name in the DataReader ("dataa.csv" to "data.csv"). ![PROGRAM COULDN'T COMPILE]!
2. Changed usage to "var" where possible.
3. Removed minor redundant code.
4. Checked if imported lines are empty or invalid, i.e. have less than 7 columns. ![PROGRAM COULDN'T COMPILE]!
5. "Main" should be private and "Program" can be static.
6. Replaced "for (int i = 0; i < importedLines.Count; i++)" with "foreach (var importedLine in importedLines)".
7. The "ImportedObjects" list shouldn't be initialized with an empty object. ![PROGRAM COULDN'T COMPILE]!
8. Removed base class for ImportedObject, as it's not adding to the functionality in this case.
9. Removed unnecessary parameter from "public void ImportAndPrintData".
10. Inverted multiple if-statements in "public void ImportAndPrintData" to reduce nesting.
11. Removed "Console.ReadLine();" at the end of "public void ImportAndPrintData" to make the program exit automatically.
12. Moved class ImportedObject to a separate file for more  and set its modifier to internal.
13. Renamed ImportedObjects list to _importedObjects and added a private modifier.
14. Changed the NumberOfChildren field type (in ImportedObject) from double to int, because in this case we operate on just integers.
15. Fixed styling (mainly in ImportedObject class).
16. Removed unused directives in both Program.cs and DataReader.cs.
